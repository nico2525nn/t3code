/**
 * Home threads — the one thread per agent instance that receives its agent's
 * proactive output.
 *
 * Hermes has a first-class "home channel" concept: a per-platform default
 * destination for output nobody asked for at a specific address — a cron job's
 * result, an agent-initiated `send_message`, a gateway online notice, a
 * `/handoff`. Every other Hermes surface designates one interactively via
 * `/sethome`. T3 designates one automatically instead, because there is no
 * "current channel" here for a user to point at: threads are created on
 * demand, and asking someone to pick one before their first cron job can fire
 * is setup for a decision they have no basis to make.
 *
 * ## Converge-on-read, like agent projects
 *
 * `getOrCreateHomeThread` is a **precondition every caller runs**, not a
 * lifecycle event one caller owns — the same reasoning as
 * `getOrCreateAgentProject`, and for the same failure modes: an instance
 * enrolled before this shipped has no designation, a dispatch that failed once
 * would otherwise leave the instance permanently unable to receive, and a
 * thread deleted out from under the designation would strand every future
 * delivery. Each of those self-heals on the next handshake.
 *
 * ## Why settings and not a table
 *
 * The designation is per-instance enrollment metadata, exactly like
 * `connectorUrl` and `revoked`, and it lives beside them in the Hermes
 * instance's config blob. That keeps one source of truth for "facts about this
 * enrollment" and avoids a migration for a single nullable id.
 *
 * The plugin's `T3_HOME_CHANNEL` env var is a *cache* of this value, reconciled
 * on every `connection.accepted`. This module is authoritative; drift is
 * bounded by one reconnect.
 *

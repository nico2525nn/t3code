/**
 * Agent projects — the synthetic project rows that back directoryless threads.
 *
 * `projection_threads.project_id` is `NOT NULL`, so a thread with a provider
 * that owns its own machine (Hermes) still needs a project row to point at.
 * That row is *synthetic*: `agentInstanceId` is set, its workspace root is a
 * real but empty directory under `<t3home>/agents/<instanceId>/`, and every
 * "pick a project" surface filters it out.
 *
 * ## Why converge-on-read instead of create-on-enrollment
 *
 * The obvious design is to create the project when an instance enrolls and
 * delete it when the instance is removed. That leaves the system able to reach
 * states it cannot recover from on its own:
 *
 *   - enrollment succeeds but the project dispatch fails → the instance has no
 *     project, forever, and every thread start fails
 *   - instances enrolled before this code shipped have no project at all
 *   - a project soft-deleted by hand (or by a removal that later gets undone)
 *     leaves live threads unopenable
 *
 * `getOrCreateAgentProject` is instead a **precondition every caller runs**,
 * not a lifecycle event one caller owns. It reads, and creates only what is
 * missing. Any of the states above self-heals on the next call, and callers
 * never have to reason about ordering. Enrollment still calls it, but only to
 * warm the row — nothing depends on that call having happened.

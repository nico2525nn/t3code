/**
 * HermesConnectionRegistry — owner of **volatile** Hermes gateway liveness.
 *
 * Everything in here is deliberately memory-only and is never persisted:
 * the live connection, its transport, `lastSeen`, `activeSessionCount`, the
 * reported model, and the `upgrade-required` observation.
 *
 * Why liveness must not be persisted
 * ----------------------------------
 * `ProviderInstanceRegistryLive.reconcile` structurally compares each
 * `ProviderInstanceConfig` envelope and closes the instance scope on **any**
 * change. Closing that scope runs `HermesAdapter`'s finalizer, which calls
 * `stopAll()` and sends `session.stop` to Hermes for every live thread. So
 * writing something like `connectedAt` into the instance config on every
 * connect would tear down every Hermes session on every reconnect.
 *
 * The broker (and therefore this registry) is a top-level layer that survives
 * reconcile, which makes it the correct owner of liveness. The accepted
 * consequence is that after a T3 server restart the UI reports "never
 * connected" until the plugin dials back in. That is intended.
 *
 * Generation fencing
 * ------------------
 * Every accepted connection gets a monotonically increasing generation. All
 * post-acceptance mutations are fenced on it, and the comparison happens
 * *inside* the `Ref` update rather than as a separate read, so a replacement
 * landing concurrently cannot be clobbered by a stale writer (TOCTOU).

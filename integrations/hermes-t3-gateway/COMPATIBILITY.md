# Hermes event compatibility inventory

The plugin deliberately uses only the public Hermes plugin and platform-adapter
surfaces audited at Hermes Agent upstream commit `62e07223` (v0.19.0).

recovery in `session.ready` and authoritative `content.snapshot` replacement;
older server/plugin pairs are rejected during the handshake.

## Known limitations

- The platform adapter receives cumulative rendered text, not the underlying
  token stream category. The current adapter maps it to `assistant_text`; Hermes reasoning,
  plan, and command-output stream categories are not publicly exposed here.
- Prefix-extending cumulative edits emit `content.delta`; edits that revise or
  clear already-emitted text emit an authoritative `content.snapshot`.
- Hermes' exact first-chat T3 home-channel notice is suppressed at the adapter
  output boundary. The plugin does not assign a home channel or redirect
  proactive delivery; other Hermes platform notices pass through unchanged.
  This match is **exact string equality**, which is fragile: Hermes builds the
  notice inline from an f-string (`gateway/run.py:13780`) rather than exporting
  a constant, so any wording change upstream silently stops the suppression and
  the notice reaches the transcript. Re-verified byte-for-byte at 62e07223 by
  reconstructing the f-string with `platform_name="t3"` (`Platform("t3").value`
  → `"t3"`, `.title()` → `"T3"`) and the non-Slack `/sethome` branch; it still
  matches. A regression test pins the literal.
- Hermes' documented tool hook surface exposes a `task_id`, tool name,
  arguments, string result, and duration. Verified at 62e07223: the runtime
  additionally supplies `session_id`, `tool_call_id`, `turn_id`,
  `api_request_id`, and `middleware_trace` on both hooks
  (`hermes_cli/plugins.py:2146` for `pre_tool_call`, `model_tools.py:1050` for
  `post_tool_call`), and `post_tool_call` also supplies `status`, `error_type`,
  and `error_message`. The adapter consumes `session_id`, `tool_call_id`, and
  `status` when present and falls back to the documented IDs for older
  versions. It projects only canonical, whitelisted fields (command/cwd, file
  path, search query, image path, or MCP server/operation); arbitrary arguments
  and raw results never cross the wire.
- `post_tool_call` passes `result` as `Any`, not a guaranteed `str` — the
  adapter never forwards it, so the looser type is inert here.
- **The tool hooks' `session_id` is not this plugin's session id.** Hermes
  passes `agent.session_id` (`agent/tool_executor.py:188`, `:305`, `:341`),
  which the gateway sets from `SessionEntry.session_id` — a timestamped run id
  like `20260725_143012_ab12cd34` (`gateway/session.py:2388`,
  `agent/agent_init.py:1446-1453`). This plugin's session ids come from
  `build_session_key` (`gateway/session.py:1029`) and are shaped
  `agent:main:t3:dm:<thread>`. The two namespaces never intersect, so keying
  the thread lookup on the hook's value alone matched nothing and silently
  dropped every tool activity item. This is the same class of defect as the
  `finalize` bug — keying behaviour off a Hermes-supplied value whose meaning
  was assumed rather than verified. `_turn_for_tool_hook` now resolves in three
  steps: the raw `session_id` as a routing key (free, and correct if upstream
  ever passes the gateway key here), then `HERMES_SESSION_KEY` from Hermes'
  session context (`gateway/run.py:17367` →
  `gateway/session_context.py:200`, read via `get_session_env` at `:303`),
  which IS the `build_session_key` value and is propagated into the tool worker
  threads by `propagate_context_to_thread` (`agent/tool_executor.py:715`), then
  the sole active turn when exactly one exists. With two or more concurrent
  turns and no routing key it emits nothing rather than misattributing activity
  to the wrong thread. Every step is best-effort and cannot raise: tool
  activity is decorative and must never break a turn.

  Regression shape if upstream changes: if `HERMES_SESSION_KEY` stops being
  bound or stops propagating into tool threads, a **multi-thread** Hermes loses
  tool activity rows (single-thread still works via the sole-turn fallback).
  Turn lifecycle is unaffected either way — tool items are decorative.

- Approval resolution is session-FIFO in Hermes. T3 request IDs identify the UI
  prompt, then resolve the oldest matching Hermes approval for that session.
- The public `clarify` hook is a single question. The wire protocol supports an
  array so richer structured input can be added without a protocol break.
- Hermes session completion has no dedicated platform-adapter callback. The
  plugin uses `notify=True` metadata on `send` as the authoritative completion
  boundary (`_mark_notify_metadata`, `gateway/platforms/base.py:89`). It
  explicitly does **not** use `finalize=True` on `edit_message`, which upstream
  sets on every mid-turn tool-progress edit and every stream segment break —
  see "Turn completion is keyed off `notify`, never `finalize`" below.
- Active `/steer` dispatch returns a textual Hermes control acknowledgement
  through the normal platform `send(..., notify=True)` path
  (`gateway/platforms/base.py:4926`). The plugin captures that response in the
  originating steering request's async context and suppresses it from the
  transcript. Because a steer targets a _running_ turn, the capture is
  correlated by the steering `requestId` — which the base adapter passes back
  as `reply_to` via `_reply_anchor_for_event` — and not by `chat_id`. Genuine
  assistant output emitted on the same thread during the steer window carries a
  different correlation id and reaches the transcript untouched.
- The plugin acknowledges T3 only when the audited Hermes success response
  begins with `⏩ Steer queued`. That prefix is likewise matched against an
  inline f-string (`gateway/run.py:11280`) rather than an exported constant, so
  it carries the same drift risk as the home-channel notice. Confirmed present
  at 62e07223. Unknown future response shapes fail closed with `protocol.error`
  rather than completing the turn.
- Hermes' configured default model is read once per handshake from the
  documented read-only accessor `load_config_readonly()["model"]["default"]`.
  That accessor returns the shared process-wide config cache and its docstring
  forbids mutation, so the plugin copies out only a trimmed string. Any failure
  — missing key, import error, older Hermes — omits the optional `model` field
  from `connection.hello` rather than sending null or empty.
- Hermes' configured reasoning effort is read from
  `load_config_readonly()["agent"]["reasoning_effort"]` on every
  `describe.request`, with the same discipline as the model read above: a
  trimmed string copy, no mutation of the shared cache, and any failure omits
  the optional `reasoningEffort` field rather than sending null or empty. Note
  this is the _global_ effort. Hermes also supports
  `agent.reasoning_overrides` (per-model) and `delegation.reasoning_effort`
  (subagents); neither is resolved here, so a user with a per-model override
  active sees the global value on the Agent page.
- Skills are enumerated through the registered `skills_list()` tool surface
  (`tools/skills_tool.py:785`), not the private `_find_all_skills()` scanner
  behind it. Consequences of that choice, all verified at 62e07223:
  - `skills_list()` already applies Hermes' disabled-skill, platform, and
    environment filters, so **disabled skills are absent from the list rather
    than reported with `enabled: false`**. The wire field is always `true`.
    Reporting disabled skills would require `_find_all_skills(skip_disabled=True)`
    plus `hermes_cli.skills_config.get_disabled_skills()` — a private scanner
    and a config-mutating module — so T3 shows what this Hermes would actually
    load, not the full on-disk inventory.
  - The surface publishes only `name`, `description`, and `category`. There is
    **no path or install-source field**: `category` is the nearest published
    analogue and is sent as `source`. The real on-disk path is available only
    from `skill_view()` per skill, so it is not eagerly fetched.
  - The list reflects `~/.hermes/skills/` plus configured `skills.external_dirs`,
    and is served from a 30s in-process cache keyed on a directory-mtime and
    disabled-set signature. A skill added seconds before a `describe.request`
    may be one refresh late.
  - MCP servers are not reported at all. Hermes has no public enumeration
    surface for them at this commit, and the T3 contract omits the field in v1.
- Skill bodies are read with `skill_view(name, preprocess=False)`. Preprocessing
  is disabled deliberately: T3 renders the skill for a human to read, so the
  literal authored markdown is wanted rather than Hermes' template and
  inline-shell rendering of it — the latter executes shell fragments embedded in
  the skill, which must not happen merely because a user expanded a row. Bodies
  are truncated at 512 KiB. Any failure — unknown name, ambiguous name across
  `external_dirs`, unreadable file, older Hermes — replies with `markdown: null`
  rather than an error, so the UI renders "no body available" instead of a
  protocol failure. The plugin calls `skill_view` directly rather than the
  registered `_skill_view_with_bump` handler, so a T3 body fetch does **not**
  bump that skill's view/use counters (`tools/skill_usage.py`) — browsing an
  agent's skills in T3 must not look like the agent loading one, since
  `last_used_at` is what Hermes' curator keys its stale-skill timer off.
- Neither describe frame can fail the connection over a _Hermes_ problem.
  Every Hermes-sourced read degrades — omitted optional field, empty skill
  list, or null markdown — so a `describe.request` against an older or
  partially-broken Hermes yields a thinner reply, never a `protocol.error`.
  The one exception is a malformed request: `skill.body.request` with no
  `skillName` cannot be answered, because the response echoes the name back
  and the wire type is non-empty. That takes the ordinary correlated
  `protocol.error` path.
- Attachments are not accepted. They are the first planned post-stability
  feature; the capability is reserved and fixed to `false` in protocol v2.

## Turn completion is keyed off `notify`, never `finalize`

**A previous revision of this document blamed `format_tool_event` for the
early-turn-truncation bug. That diagnosis was wrong.** It is corrected here;
the real cause and the real completion signal are documented below.

### The signal that ends a turn: `notify=True` on `send`

`_mark_notify_metadata` (`gateway/platforms/base.py:89`) stamps `notify: True`
onto the metadata of a send, and the gateway applies it **only** for genuine
user-visible replies:

- the final response delivery (`gateway/platforms/base.py:5220`, consumed at
  `:5261`, `:5330`, `:5376`, `:5418`, `:5433`-`:5469`),
- slash-command acknowledgements (`:4827`, `:4934`, `:4987`),
- and, in the streaming path, `StreamConsumer._metadata_for_send(final=True)`
  (`gateway/stream_consumer.py:328-329`).

`send(..., metadata={"notify": True})` is therefore the plugin's completion
boundary, and `_complete_turn` is reached from nowhere else on the output path.

### The signal that does NOT end a turn: `finalize=True` on `edit_message`

`finalize` reads like "last edit of the response", and the base class documents
it that way (`gateway/platforms/base.py:3178-3186`). It is **not** a turn
boundary. Two upstream paths set it mid-turn:

1. **The tool-progress loop.** When an adapter declares
   `REQUIRES_EDIT_FINALIZE`, `_edit_progress_message` passes `finalize=True` on
   **every** progress-bubble edit (`gateway/run.py:20777-20780`) — once per tool
   event, for the whole turn. Nothing about that edit is final.
2. **The stream consumer's segment breaks.** `_send_or_edit` is called with
   `finalize=(got_done or got_segment_break)`
   (`gateway/stream_consumer.py:938-940`), so every mid-turn tool/segment
   boundary finalizes the current content message. This path is
   **independent of `REQUIRES_EDIT_FINALIZE`** — setting the flag to `False`
   does not suppress it.

This plugin previously declared `REQUIRES_EDIT_FINALIZE = True` and treated
`finalize=True` in `edit_message` as "turn finished", calling `_complete_turn`.
Consequently the **first tool call ended the T3 turn while Hermes was still
working**: the transcript kept the progress chrome ("📚 Reading skill
hermes-agent 🔍 Searching the web for …") as the assistant's entire answer, and
every subsequent send failed with `Send failed: no active T3 turn — trying
plain-text fallback` in the gateway log. The real answer never arrived.

The fix is twofold, and both halves are needed because of path (2) above:

- `REQUIRES_EDIT_FINALIZE = False` — declaring it only arms path (1). T3 closes
  an item on `item.completed`, which this plugin emits itself; it has no
  rich-card streaming state that needs an explicit close.
- `edit_message` ignores `finalize` outright (`del metadata, finalize`) and
  never calls `_complete_turn` — this is what defends against path (2).

`test_tool_progress_bubble_edits_never_complete_the_turn` pins both legs:
it replays the gateway's `_edit_progress_message` closure verbatim and a
segment-break finalize, asserts the turn survives every one, then asserts a
single `notify=True` send completes it exactly once.

**Regression shape if upstream changes.** If a future Hermes makes `finalize`
genuinely mean "turn over" and removes the mid-turn uses, this plugin will
simply never see a completion via that route — harmless, since `notify` still
fires. The dangerous direction is the inverse: if `_mark_notify_metadata` stops
being applied to the final delivery (or the streaming path stops calling
`_metadata_for_send(final=True)`), turns would **never complete** — T3 threads
would hang in the running state with the full answer streamed but no
`turn.completed`. That is the opposite failure mode from the original bug and
would show up as spinners that never resolve, not truncated answers.

## Tool-progress chrome: the `format_tool_event` override is not the defence

The plugin overrides `format_tool_event` to return `None`
(`gateway/platforms/base.py:2740`), which `gateway/stream_dispatch.py:108`
documents as "adapter chose to eat this event". T3 already renders tool calls as
typed `item.started` / `item.completed` activity from the `pre_tool_call` /
`post_tool_call` hooks, so the text line is a strictly poorer duplicate.

**At 62e07223 this hook is dead code on the live path.** Its only caller is
`GatewayEventDispatcher` (`gateway/stream_dispatch.py:40`, dispatch at `:108`),
and that class is referenced nowhere in the shipped gateway — only from
`tests/gateway/test_stream_events.py`. The path that actually runs is
`gateway/run.py:20485+`, which builds the same emoji lines itself and delivers
them via `adapter.send` / `adapter.edit_message`, with **no adapter hook to
suppress them**. Chrome visibility there is governed by the platform's
`tool_progress` display setting (`gateway/display_config.py:187`), not by this
override.

The override is kept as documented-contract defence: it costs nothing and
becomes load-bearing again if upstream routes chrome through the dispatcher. But
it never protected the turn — ignoring `finalize` does.

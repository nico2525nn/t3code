"""In-process compensation for two upstream `send_message` media defects.

Both defects live in Hermes core's `tools/send_message_tool.py` and both are
about plugin platforms that *can* carry media but are not on core's hard-coded
prose list. Line numbers below are against **Hermes v0.19.0**.

**Bug A — the false warning (cosmetic, but it lies to the agent).**
`tools/send_message_tool.py:1108-1113` precomputes::

    warning = f"MEDIA attachments were omitted for {platform.value}; ..."

whenever `media_files` is non-empty and the platform is not one of the nine
names spelled out in that string. Line 1154-1157 then appends it to *any*
successful result without ever consulting whether the send actually dropped
anything. Our standalone sender delivers media as `media.deliver` frames and
waits for the acks — and is then told, in the same JSON blob, that the files
were omitted. A live agent read that warning and reported a delivery failure to
the user for files T3 had already rendered.

**Bug B — the silent drop (the one that actually loses data).**
`tools/send_message_tool.py:711-732`: when the gateway is co-resident, the
runner weakref resolves and `runner.adapters.get(platform)` returns our live
adapter, so core calls::

    result = await adapter.send(chat_id=chat_id, content=chunk, metadata=metadata)

and returns. `media_files` is never passed. It cannot be recovered from
`content` either, because `BasePlatformAdapter.extract_media`
(`tools/send_message_tool.py:442`) already stripped the `MEDIA:` directives out
of the text before chunking. So `send_message` / `hermes send` with attachments,
run in the same process as `hermes gateway`, loses the files with no error and
no warning. This went unnoticed in live testing only because `hermes send` ran
out-of-process, where the runner weakref is empty and core falls through to the
`standalone_sender_fn` path (line 731+), which does pass `media_files`.

**What this module does.** At plugin load it wraps the two functions in the
already-imported `tools.send_message_tool` module object:

* `_send_via_adapter` — for platform `t3` with non-empty `media_files`, skip
  core's live-adapter shortcut entirely and call our own `standalone_send`
  (from `.home`), which handles media correctly. Text-only `t3` sends and every
  other platform reach the original function untouched.
* `_send_to_platform` — post-process the result, dropping the Bug A warning from
  `result["warnings"]`. Matched by the stable prefix `"MEDIA attachments were
  omitted for t3"`, never the full prose: the nine-platform list inside that
  sentence changes between releases, and matching it exactly would silently
  stop working on the next upgrade.

**Removable.** Both wrappers become dead weight the moment upstream grows
capability-driven media handling — i.e. once `PlatformEntry` can advertise
"this platform delivers media" and core consults it instead of the hard-coded
list, and once the co-resident branch forwards `media_files` to `adapter.send`.
Delete this module and its `register()` call at that point; nothing else in the
plugin depends on it.

**Fail-open contract.** This module never raises into the plugin's `register()`
and never makes a working Hermes worse:

* Every patch feature-detects its target first — the module must be importable,
  the attribute must exist, it must be a coroutine function, and its signature
  must carry the parameters we rely on. Any mismatch means no patch.
* On any failure we log exactly one warning and leave core untouched. The
  fallback is the current upstream behaviour: buggy, but working and known.
* An upstream upgrade that renames, re-signatures, or restructures these
  functions therefore degrades to "unpatched", never to a crash.
* Applying twice is a no-op — the wrappers carry a marker attribute.

Even fully failed open, the residual damage is bounded: `standalone_send`
stamps `media_count` / `acked_count` / a delivered-count `note` onto every
success result (see `home.py`), so the false warning always sits next to
counter-evidence. The un-compensated Bug B remains a real silent drop, which is
why the patch is attempted at all.

        if media_files and not message.strip():

    results are returned without even being inspected.

    A success from our sender means the frames were handed over — acked, or

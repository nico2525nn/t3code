# Scripts

- `vp run dev` — Starts contracts, server, and web in watch mode.
- `vp run dev --share` (or `vp run dev:share`) — Same, plus publishes the web port on this machine's tailnet over HTTPS via `tailscale serve`. Prints the shareable URL, and the pairing URL is built against it so it can be opened from a phone or another laptop as-is. The mapping is removed on exit; if the tailnet is unavailable, the dev server still starts locally and logs a warning.
- `vp run dev:pair` — Prints a fresh pairing URL for the dev server already running against this data directory, resolving its port and web origin from `server-runtime.json`. Searches both the `dev` and `userdata` state directories and requires the recorded process to still be alive, so a crashed server's leftover state file is not mistaken for a running one. Add `--base-dir <path>` only when the server was started with `--home-dir`.
- `vp run dev:server` — Starts just the WebSocket server. The server process runs on Bun (`@effect/platform-bun` + `BunPtyAdapter`), but task running uses `vp run`.
- `vp run dev:web` — Starts just the Vite dev server for the web app.
- Dev commands run from a **git worktree** default to that worktree's own gitignored `.t3`, so feature work never writes to the data directory the installed app uses. This deliberately outranks an ambient `T3CODE_HOME`; pass `--home-dir <path>` to choose somewhere else.
- From the **main checkout**, dev commands implicitly use `~/.t3/dev`, keeping development state separate from `~/.t3/userdata`. An explicit `--home-dir <path>` stores state under `<path>/userdata`; the base directory remains available for caches, worktrees, and other shared data.
- Web dev commands do not auto-open a browser. Open the one-time pairing URL printed by the server so the first browser navigation is authenticated. Set `T3CODE_NO_BROWSER=0` only when interactive auto-open is intentional.
- Pass dev-runner flags directly after the root task name, for example:
  `vp run dev --home-dir /tmp/t3code-dev`
- `vp run start` — Runs the production server (serves built web app as static files).
- `vp run build` — Builds contracts, web app, and server.
- `vp run typecheck` — Strict TypeScript checks for all packages.
- `vp run test` — Runs workspace tests.
- `node apps/server/scripts/t3-sqlite-state.ts <query|exec> --base-dir <path> ...` — Inspects or seeds an isolated T3 SQLite database; writes create a private backup first.
- `vp run dist:desktop:artifact -- --platform <mac|linux|win> --target <target> --arch <arch>` — Builds a desktop artifact for a specific platform/target/arch.
- `vp run dist:desktop:dmg` — Builds a shareable macOS `.dmg` into `./release`.
- `vp run dist:desktop:dmg:x64` — Builds an Intel macOS `.dmg`.
- `vp run dist:desktop:linux` — Builds a Linux AppImage into `./release`.
- `vp run dist:desktop:win` — Builds a Windows NSIS installer into `./release`.

## Desktop `.dmg` packaging notes

- Default build is unsigned/not notarized for local sharing.
- The DMG build uses `assets/prod/black-macos-1024.png` as the production app icon source.
- Desktop production windows load the bundled UI from `t3code://app/index.html` (not a `127.0.0.1` document URL).
- Desktop packaging includes `apps/server/dist` (the `t3` backend) and starts it on loopback with an auth token for WebSocket/API traffic.
- Your tester can still open it on macOS by right-clicking the app and choosing **Open** on first launch.
- To keep staging files for debugging package contents, run: `vp run dist:desktop:dmg -- --keep-stage`
- To allow code-signing/notarization when configured in CI/secrets, add: `--signed`.
- Signed macOS builds also require `T3CODE_APPLE_TEAM_ID` and
  `T3CODE_MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`. The passkey RP domain is derived from
  `T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` unless `T3CODE_CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS` overrides it.
- Windows `--signed` uses Azure Trusted Signing and expects:
  `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`,
  `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`, and `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`.
- Azure authentication env vars are also required (for example service principal with secret):
  `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Running multiple dev instances

Ports resolve in this order, first match winning:

1. `T3CODE_PORT_OFFSET=<n>` — exact numeric offset, full control.
2. `T3CODE_DEV_INSTANCE=<value>` — numeric offset, or a hashed one for non-numeric values. Example: `T3CODE_DEV_INSTANCE=branch-a vp run dev:desktop`
3. **Git worktree** — the offset is hashed from the worktree path, so a worktree gets the same preferred pair every time instead of everyone starting at the default and racing for it.
4. Otherwise the defaults: server `13773`, web `5733`.

Whatever the source, this only picks a _preferred_ offset. Both ports are then checked on loopback and shifted together if either is taken, so two worktrees whose hashes collide — or one whose ports something else already holds — still start, just not on the offset they asked for. Ports are stable across restarts in practice, not guaranteed.

Which means: read the resolved values from the `[dev-runner] …` line rather than assuming them, and re-read them after a restart. `--dry-run` prints them without starting anything (it resolves only — it will not touch a `--share` mapping).

## Browser dev is single-origin

`dev` and `dev:web` deliberately leave `VITE_HTTP_URL` and `VITE_WS_URL` unset so
the client resolves its backend from `window.location.origin`, with Vite proxying
`/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known` to the server. That is what lets a dev
server work unchanged from a tailnet name, a LAN IP, or a phone.

Setting those variables for web dev compiles absolute `localhost` URLs into the
bundle, and any browser that isn't on this machine will then try to reach its own
localhost. `dev:desktop` still sets them, because the Electron renderer talks to
the backend directly.

Non-`.ts.net` hostnames need `T3CODE_DEV_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated) to pass
Vite's host check; `T3CODE_DEV_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` does the same for the server's
CORS allowlist.
